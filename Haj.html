    <p>The start of operations for the Hajj season this year was recently confirmed by the Saudi authorities as the country prepares to receive millions of Muslim pilgrims.</p>

    <p>The Saudi Minister of Hajj and Umrah Tawfiq Al-Rabiah made the statement at the conclusion of a four-day Hajj and Umrah Services Conference held in Jeddah.</p>

    <p>The conference aimed to highlight Saudi Arabia’s distinctive programmes for Hajj pilgrims, stressing a priority on increasing service quality for Hajj and Umrah.</p>

    <p>The summit also underlined a commitment to provide improved services for these sacred journeys and facilitated the entry of pilgrims and Umrah performers worldwide.</p>

    <p>At this conference, a number of cutting-edge services and technologies that complemented the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 were introduced.</p>

    <p>At the end of the conference, Tawfiq Al-Rabiah expressed gratitude to King Salman, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, for his kind support of the third edition of the Hajj and Umrah Services Conference and Exhibition.</p>

    <p>The Saudi government is wrapping up plans for the 2024 Hajj and officially ending Hajj arrangements. Most countries have successfully signed Hajj agreements, including Pakistan.</p>

    <p>Pakistan has secured approximately 179,000 tickets for the Hajj, with half of these being occupied by private Hajj operators.</p>
