    According to the FIA spokesperson, under the guidance of Director FIA Karachi Zone Zaheem Iqbal Sheikh, a crackdown was initiated for the arrest of proclaimed offenders, and a raid was conducted under the supervision of Deputy Director Commercial Banking Circle Karachi Ali Murad.

The spokesperson said that suspect arrested for involvement in banking fraud and deception was employed as a cashier at a private bank branch in the Saddar area. The suspect, Ghulam Muhammad, consumed poison upon arrest. The spokesperson said that collectively, Ghulam and other suspects embezzled Rs32,978,000, issued fake cash transit transactions through various branches, and transit cash entries without authorization.

According to preliminary investigations, no requests for obtaining cash were received from the mentioned branches. After entering cash, the suspects did not use the mentioned van meant for cash transit. The spokesperson said fake cash entries were made in May, June, and July of the previous year, and after committing fraud, the suspects went into hiding, and raids were being conducted to apprehend other suspects. Special raid teams have been formed in this regard.
