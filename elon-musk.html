    <p>Elon Musk, the owner of X, returned to the cisgender engagement pool and scolded people for using the word <q>cis</q> calling it a <q>heterophobic</q> slur.</p>

    <p>In a seemingly spontaneous social media post, Musk fully expressed his detest for the term <q>cisgender</q> according to the Washington Times.</p>

    <p><q>Cis is a heterophobic word. Shame on anyone who uses it,</q> the billionaire wrote.
Many of Musk's supporters responded to the post in the replies, setting off an inevitable firestorm.</p>

    <p>A regular commenter on X concurred with Musk and shared the findings of an X survey indicating that 78% of respondents thought the term <q>cis</q> was derogatory. In response, another user created another poll, to which, as of Thursday, 63% of participants agreed that the term "cis" is derogatory.</p>

    <p>In response, journalist Victoria Brownworth provided the standard definition of cisgender.</p>

    <p><q>Cis(gender) describes a person whose gender identity corresponds to their sex assigned at birth,<q> she wrote. <q>It is the opposite of trans(gender). It has zero to do with sexual orientation and this is neither ‘heterophobic’ nor homophobic. Please learn how to Google.</q></p>
